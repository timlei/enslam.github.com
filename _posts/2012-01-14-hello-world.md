Hi All,

Over the last couple of years I've been meaning to setup a blog.

The main thing that's prevented me so that is getting caught up wanting to explore the technology behind the blog instead of actually producing awesome content.

As content is what makes blogging worth while, I've descided to use Blogger so that I can't modify the back end and focus on content.

Anyway, you should be seeing some interesting posts over the next few days about some interesting developments in the .Net open source community.
