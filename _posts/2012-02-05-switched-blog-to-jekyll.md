This weekend I've spent some time migrating my blog from Blogger to a github hosted [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) site.

The reason for this was that there were a number of things that blogger was lacking such as syntax highlighting and the flexibility to [play around with the back end](https://github.com/enslam/enslam.github.com).

Even though not being able to modify back end code was one of the positives for using Blogger in the first place, I wanted to switch the blog from a subdomain to a top level domain and didn't want to be restricted in the content that I could generate.
