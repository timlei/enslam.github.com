Just over a week ago twitter released v2.0 of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Bootstrap is, for those of you who don't already know, a framework for all skill levels to help setup websites easier, better and faster.

After looking though the examples I wanted to try it out so I've restyled my website with Bootstrap.

There are a number of really nice things that you get out of the box with Bootstrap that I believe make it very easy to get a basic site up and running in no time.

The main ones that I used were:

- [Grid system](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#grid-system) - used to layout the page
- [Nav, tabs, and pills](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#navs) - used to generate the [Tags](/tags) page
- [Navbar](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#navbar) - self explanatory
- [Alerts](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#alerts) - used to display information about posts

Of all of the features in Bootstrap I feel that the Grid system provides the most value as it allows you to easily develop a responsive design.

What do you think is the best feature of Bootstrap?
